            1. Store natural peanut butter upside down so it won't separate as much.<br>
            2. If you have trouble making a decision, flip a coin. While you're waiting to get the result, your mind automatically starts to wish for what it wants.<br>
            3. For the most reliable information on Amazon items, read the three- and four-star reviews.<br>
            4. If there's a jar or container you can't open, run the lid under hot water for 30 seconds.<br>

                This is a picture of the University which I'm current study on -- The University of Washington. It has a really wonderful campus, which is famous for its sakura during April. Lots of people from all over the world come to take pictures during that time. It's feeling really relaxing even just work through the campus.
